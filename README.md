# ReadAR
## Description
ReadAR is a project based on a book sharing platform. 
The registered users can enlist their books to be shared with other members of the platform, share details of the book, share their contact info for any further communication needed for the sharing process. 
A basic case example would be a student being not able to reach a library and it's contents, therefore needing an assistance from any willing individual who is currently member of the given library. They would be able to easily contact each other and complete their sacred mission on sharing the needed books.
The system works with basic listings, I add a book and it's information on the platform, and in case you need the very same book you search for it and find it, and as my contact info is given with the book listing, you contact me for the sharing process.
